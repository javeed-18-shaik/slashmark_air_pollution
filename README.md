# 🌫️ IoT-Based Air Pollution Monitoring System

This project uses MQ135 and MQ6 sensors to measure air quality in real time. It displays PPM values on an LCD, triggers alerts when thresholds are crossed, and logs data to ThingSpeak.

## 🔧 Features
- Real-time gas detection (CO2, LPG, smoke)
- Alerts via buzzer
- LCD PPM display
- Cloud logging to ThingSpeak

## 🔌 Hardware
- Arduino Uno / NodeMCU
- MQ135 & MQ6 gas sensors
- 16x2 LCD
- WiFi (ESP8266) module
- Buzzer
